// Navigation.h
// This considers the Next Waypoint and the Previous Waypoint and the permitted Cross Track Error (Boundary).
// It then calculates the desired Distance and Bearing to Waypoint.
// It also considers whether the current leg of the mission has been completed.

// V1.1 30/8/2016 updated for reorganisation of navigation global variables into a structure
// V1.2 12/9/2016 added enumerated type for current steering method.
// V1.3 9/11/2016 added prev_WP_valid
// V1.4 12/11/2017 updated to change BRL to RLB.
// V1.5 14/4/2018 added GPS directly provided course and speed to Navdata object
// V1.6 20/6/2020 added VMG and VMC, SOG_Avg and COG_Avg
// V1.7 2/1/2021 added Laylines for running to the NavData structure
//				 added Port and Starboard Tack Running to SteeringCourseType enum
